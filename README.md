Computer Vision Bird Species Detection ü¶úüì∑

Overview

This project is a Bird Species Detection System using Computer Vision. By leveraging Deep Learning and Image Processing, the model identifies different bird species from images with high accuracy.

Features

CNN-based Image Classification: Uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for species detection.

Pretrained Model Integration: Implements models like ResNet, VGG, or EfficientNet.

Real-time Detection: Supports real-time classification using a webcam.

Dataset Processing: Preprocessing of bird image datasets for training and testing.

User Interface: Simple web app to upload and analyze bird images.

Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python üêç

Deep Learning Framework: TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch

Computer Vision: OpenCV for image processing

Web Interface: Flask or FastAPI for deployment

Dataset: Public bird species datasets (e.g., CUB-200, NABirds)

Usage

Upload an image of a bird.

The model processes the image and predicts the species.

The detected species and confidence score are displayed.

Example Output

Input: Image of a Bald EagleOutput: ü¶Ö Predicted Species: Bald Eagle (Confidence: 92%)

Future Enhancements

Integration with Mobile Apps for on-the-go bird identification.

Larger Dataset Training to improve species classification.

Real-time Video Processing for live bird detection.
